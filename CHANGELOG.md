- risk: Add unrealized pnl calculations for spread accounts. ([#119](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/119))

### Breaking

- instruction: `InitializeOpenOrders` now takes explicit payer. This affects placing an order on a new market. ([#121](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/121))

## [0.14.1]

- oracle: `OraclePrice` now contains `lastUpdatedTime` which is seconds since Linux epoch. `GetPriceAge` can be called to get the time between `now` and `lastUpdatedTime`. (([#115](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/115)))
- oracle: Now has explicit `pollPrice` function to fetch the latest oracle price manually. (([#115](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/115)))

- client: Expose whitelist deposit address. ([#112](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/112))

### Breaking

- instruction: `InitializeMarginAccount` now explicitly specifies the payer for composability reasons. ([#108](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/108))
- instruction: `InitializeMarginAccount` no longer requires a nonce to be passed in for the PDA generation. ([#102](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/102))
- client: SDK type `Position` field `position` has been renamed to `size`. ([#102](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/102))
- program-types: Smart contract type `Position` field `position` has been renamed to `size`. ([#102](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/102))
- program-types: `MarginAccount` field `positions` of type `Position` has been renamed to `productLedgers` of type `ProductLedger` that contains a `Position` and a `OrderState`. `Position` contains `size` and `costOfTrades` and `OrderState` contains opening and closing order data. ([#102](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/102))
- events: new code in anchor for deserializing events. This update is required for `TradeEvent` to be deserialized correctly.

Note: As the memory layout of Zeta accounts has not changed, merely refactored or renamed, using an older version of the SDK for existing accounts is not breaking as it will still deserialize correctly. Updating to the latest SDK will let users access the newest features and improvements.

- The only breaking portion is calling `InitializeMarginAccount` on new account deposits.

## [0.13.0] 2022-03-13

- anchor: bump to v0.22.1. ([#98](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/98))

## [0.9.3] 2021-12-24

- general: Rename margin parameters to be more intuitive from `optionBase` to `optionDynamic`. ([#44](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/44))
- exchange: Fix race condition on `Exchange.load` that would result in NaN margin requirements temporarily. ([#44](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/44))

- client: Deposit limit for non white-listed users. ([#40](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/40))

### Breaking

- events: TradeEvent now emits `costOfTrades` instead of `price`. Users can use `utils.getTradeEventPrice(event)` to get the trade price. If your order was a taker and traded against multiple orders in the one insert, the TradeEvent will aggregate across each execution. As a result, the trade price returned is the average trade price across the total taker size. ([#45](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/45))
- events: TradeEvent size is now a BN. ([#45](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/45))
- client: Users can only deposit up to a threshold where their balance + unrealized_pnl + new deposit < deposit limit unless they are previously whitelisted. Deposit limit can be found in the `Exchange.state` account. ([#40](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/40))
