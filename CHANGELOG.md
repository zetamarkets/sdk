- general: Rename margin parameters to be more intuitive from `optionBase` to `optionDynamic`. ([#44](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/44))
- exchange: Fix race condition on `Exchange.load` that would result in NaN margin requirements temporarily. ([#44](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/44))

- client: Deposit limit for non white-listed users. ([#40](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/40))

### Breaking

- events: TradeEvent now emits `costOfTrades` instead of `price`. Users can use `utils.getTradeEventPrice(event)` to get the trade price. If your order was a taker and traded against multiple orders in the one insert, the TradeEvent will aggregate across each execution. As a result, the trade price returned is the average trade price across the total taker size. ([#45](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/45))
- events: TradeEvent size is now a BN. ([#45](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/45))
- client: Users can only deposit up to a threshold where their balance + unrealized_pnl + new deposit < deposit limit unless they are previously whitelisted. Deposit limit can be found in the `Exchange.state` account. ([#40](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/40))

- general: Add padding to `Greeks`, `MarginAccount` and `State` accounts. ([#35](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/35))

### Breaking

- general: Minimum trade tick size is now 0.001 for both options and futures. ([#35](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/35))
- client: `placeOrder`, `liquidate` and `cancelAndPlaceOrder` now expect the native integer size as the argument for size. i.e. trading 1.000 options will require you to pass in 1_000 or `convertDecimalToNativeLotSize(1)`. ([#35](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk/pull/35))
- utils: `convertNativeBNToDecimal` now takes in an optional argument for the number of fixed point precision.
