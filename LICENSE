    a. This License and the Terms of Use are the entire agreement
    between you and Licensor and supersedes any and all prior
    agreements (including the Apache 2.0 license).

    b. Nothing contained in this License will be deemed to be construed as
    creating a partnership or an agency relationship or joint venture
    between Licensee, on the one hand, and Licensor or its Affiliates, on
    the other hand.

    c. This License, and your rights hereunder, may not be assigned,
    without Licensor’s prior written consent, and any attempted

    foregoing will be null and void. Licensor may freely assign this
    License and its respective rights hereunder.

    d. A waiver by Licensor of any right or remedy under this License shall
    only be effective if it is in writing, executed by a duly authorized
    representative of Licensor and shall apply only to the circumstances
    for which it is given. Failure of Licensor to exercise or enforce any
    right or remedy under this License shall not operate as a waiver of
    such right or remedy, nor shall it prevent any future exercise or
    enforcement of such right or remedy, and no single or partial
    exercise of any right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the further
    exercise of any such right or remedy or other rights or remedies.

    e. Save for Licensor’s Affiliates who shall have the rights and benefits
    to the extent accorded thereto under this License, any person who
    is not a party hereto shall have no right under the Contracts (Rights
    of Third Parties) Act (Chapter 53B) of Singapore to enforce any
    terms of this License.

    f. This agreement shall be constituted by your acceptance of this
    License, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection
    with the subject matter or formation (including non-contractual
    disputes or claims) of such agreement, shall be governed by and
    construed in accordance with the law of Singapore.  The parties
    hereto agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or in
    connection with the subject matter or formation (including non-
    contractual disputes or claims) of this License shall be by
    arbitration, and judgment upon the award may be entered by any
    court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the
    relevant party or its assets. The arbitration shall be conducted
    under the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre
    (“SIAC”). The arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator to be
    appointed by the President of the SIAC. The seat of the arbitration
    shall be Singapore. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
    The arbitration agreement shall be governed by Singapore law.
