## Setup

This example shows how to find previous settlement prints for a given underlying, as well as historical strikes for a given expiry timestamp.

You will need to specify the expiration timestamp in the code.

This example specifies the print for `Fri Jan 07 2022 16:00:00 GMT+0800` for `$SOL` options.

```sh
npm install

ts-node settlement-print.ts
```
